<!-- Problem Description:
You are tasked with creating a simple layout using CSS Flexbox to arrange a set of elements in a row and write internal css following the following instructions:
1. Create a div with class "container".
2. Add 5 divs with the class "box" and put these 5 divs inside "container" div.
3. Use CSS Flexbox to create a row-based layout for the elements within the ".container".
4. Set the display property of the .container to create a flex container.
5. Arrange the child elements with the class ".box" in a row.
6. Ensure that the child elements have equal spacing between them.

Refer the below image to see what is the end state we want to reach.

<!-- Hints:
1. To create a flex container, use the display property with the value that makes child elements become flex items.
2. Explore the flex-direction property to control the direction of the flex container.
3. Use the appropriate property to ensure equal spacing between flex items.
4. Review the properties related to flex container alignment.
5. Experiment with different values for these properties to achieve the desired row-based layout.
-->

<!-- Solution Approach:
To create a row-based layout using Flexbox, follow these steps:

1. Set the display property of the .container to create a flex container.
2. Use the flex-direction property to specify a row-based layout.
3. Ensure that the child elements with the class .box are evenly spaced within the flex container.
-->

<!-- Test Cases:
1. Verify Inside body tag we have 1 "container" div and 5 "box" divs within.
2. Verify the elements with the class .box are arranged in a row.
3. Verify there is equal spacing between the elements.
4. Verify the elements are numbered from 1 to 5.
