<!-- Problem Description:
You are tasked with creating a responsive image gallery that adjusts its layout based on
different screen sizes using CSS Media Queries. Below, you'll find the initial HTML
structure and the CSS requirements to achieve this responsive design. Find the CSS Requirements below:

1. Create a responsive image gallery (div.image-gallery) that initially displays images in a row with two images per row.
2. Use CSS Media Queries to adjust the image gallery layout based on the screen size:
3. On screens with a width of 768px or more, display three images per row.
4. On screens with a width of 480px or less, display one image per row.
5. Ensure that the images have equal spacing and look visually appealing in all layouts.
-->

<!-- Hints:
1. Define CSS Media Queries for screen widths above and below 768px and 480px.
2. Use Flexbox properties to control the layout of the image gallery and adjust flex-basis accordingly.
-->

<!-- Solution Approach:
To create a row-based layout using Flexbox, follow these steps:

1. Set the display property of the .container to create a flex container.
2. Use the flex-direction property to specify a row-based layout.
3. Ensure that the child elements with the class .box are evenly spaced within the flex container.
-->

<!-- Test Cases:
1. For more than 768px, 3 pictures should be in a row.
2. For less than 768px and more than 480px, 2 pictures should be in a row.
3. For less than 480px, 1 picture should be in a same row.
